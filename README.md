# mettaton-2
WIP For Mettaton 2.0

FILES YOU NEED TO PROVIDE TO GET BOT TO FUNCTION:

token.txt - The Bot Token on Discord.<br>
client_secrets.json - For automatic backups to function, you will need to define a client_secrets.json from the Google Drive API<br>
.config - The bot will create this file. Use rp!setgmchannel to configure where the bot sends any GM based alerts.

The bot currently works off of 3 role names: - Please ensure these roles exist or the bot will not function correctly!

'Gamemaster' - A role that gives the user ability to modify any existing characters.

'Roleplayer' - A user is assigned this role upon any of their characters being approved.

'NPC' - The bot will ignore any users with this role.
